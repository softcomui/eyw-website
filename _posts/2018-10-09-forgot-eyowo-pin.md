Lagos, Nigeria - It was a Monday morning (September 3, 2018) in Lagos and Ciroma Chukwuma Adekunle had an interview at Softcom Limited. 

Like many job seekers, he researched the company prior to the interview. One of the discoveries he made on his fact-finding mission was that his potential employers had built a product called “Eyowo”. 

“*What is Eyowo?*”, he wondered.

As he dug further in his research, he realized that Eyowo allows for payments with a phone number. Whether he was fascinated about it or not is unclear, but he downloaded the [Eyowo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eyowo.android&hl=en_US) on his Samsung smartphone nevertheless. 

Ciroma was determined to [experience Eyowo](https://app.eyowo.com/) before facing his interviewer(s). Because “how else do you let them know that you carried out your due diligence?”

While trying to log-in to the [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eyowo.android&hl=en_US), he hurriedly set his PIN as he was eager to get right to it. He funded his Eyowo wallet with his debit card and even bought airtime with it. 

Armed with that experience, he felt ready to face the interview panel. When it comes to answering questions about the company’s products, he was certain he would have something to say. Two days before the interview, he visited the company’s website and rehearsed his elevator pitch. 

Luckily for him, the interview went well, and he was hired! 

However, by the time he opened his [Eyowo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eyowo.android&hl=en_US) on Tuesday, September 11, 2018, he just couldn’t log-in. The problem? “*Invalid password*”. By now he was staff of the company and was very aware of the internal processes that made a PIN reset possible.

But what happens to the countless people all over the country who use Eyowo daily but do not work in Softcom?

With that in mind, Ciroma has been kind enough to put together a step-by-step flow on how others like him can get their PIN-related issues resolved. 

1. Confirm that you are having an invalid or incorrect PIN issue.
2. Reach out to Eyowo. You can do so via:
    - Social media: @myeyowo on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/myeyowo/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MyEyowo) and **@eyowo** on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eyowo)
    - Email: **support@eyowo.com**
    - Phone number: **01-700 1520**
3. Allow for a maximum of **24 hours** to get a response to PIN-related issues.    

Meanwhile, you can expect *do-it-yourself* steps on how to reset your Eyowo PIN in the coming days.    
Until then, keep your login details safe and continue to enjoy Eyowo.
